# SIP_Chemicals_in_makeup:-   A data analysis using R.

Cosmetic Product Ingredients & Safety Dataset:- 
  This repository contains a dataset of cosmetic products (lipsticks, nail paints, foundations, eyeshadows, etc.) with their ingredients and associated safety information. The dataset can be   used for data analysis, machine learning, and public health research related to cosmetic safety.
  
Health Context:-

Some cosmetic ingredients may pose health risks such as:
1. Skin irritation
2. Hormone disruption
3. Other potential illnesses

Analyzing this dataset helps in:-
1. Identifying harmful ingredient trends
2. Improving cosmetic product safety
3. Supporting research on safer alternatives

Dataset:-
1. Source: Public Cosmetic Safety Repository
2. Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
3. Lang: R programming
4. Graphical and stastical both the analysis has been carried out

Main Columns:-
1. Product_Name → Name of the cosmetic product
2. Ingredients → List of ingredients used in the product
3. Category → Product category (lipstick, nail paint, foundation, eyeshadow, etc.)
4. Safety_ID → Identifier for ingredient safety classification
5. Count → Number of occurrences/mentions in dataset

Possible Use Cases:-
1. Identifying most frequent harmful chemicals
2. Comparing product categories by safety profile
3. Building machine learning models to predict product safety and more you can find in this project. (Both graphical and calculative)
